# sugar_sense

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started :
First you should have python install on you machine:
-to check go to the CMD and type: py -V

after that you should check if you have pip installed on your machine
if you don't have it installed all the commands won't work.
so go to google and check out how to download 'pip'.

next you have to run these commands in your vscode terminal:
pip install pandas
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install fastapi
pip install passlib
pip install pyodbc
pip install pydantic
pip install uvicorn
pip install hashlib
pip install requests
pip install json

after you do ALLLLL of these commands and they are all installed
then you go to your vscode terminal and MAKE SUREEE that your path is:
'THIS PART DOESN'T MATTER'/senior-project/lib/api
you can do this by doing: cd lib/api
and after that you do this command:

python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

and then the api should work on your localhost :D
